            About LazyCure</h1>
        <p>
            Congratulate you on having LazyCure - the best time tracking software in the World!</p>
        <h2>
            LazyCure Overview</h2>
        <p>
            LazyCure is a program for personal time logging, spent time analysis, working time
            usage efficiency calculation. It is the best tool for time logging of working activities
            on computer, but could also be used for the-whole-day time logging or for specific
            activities time tracking.</p>
        <h2>
            How to use</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>When you finish doing any activity, specify the activity on the main LazyCure form
                and press 'Done'.</li>
            <li>Continue doing this everytime you switching between different activities.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            Simple usage scenario</h3>
        <p>
            Let's consider the simple scenario of LazyCure usage. You come to your office, start
            computer and LazyCure. You prepare working place, start Outlook and Total Commander
            (or other programs which you are using every day). Then you open LazyCure, enter
            "prepare to work" in text field and press "Done". Then you process your email inbox
            for 20 minutes, press Ctrl+F12 (it is a hot key for activation LazyCure), enter
            "process inbox" and press "Done". In the same manner you continue to log your activities
            during the day, specifying them in LazyCure everytime you are done with one activity
            and ready to perform another.</p>
        <p>
            LazyCure will store information about your activities in Time Log Editor - it is
            available via menu Show-&gt;Time Log. At the end of a day it will be interesting
            to see summary about activities - how much time you spent on each activity during
            the day. For example, if you have a talk with Andrei Pretkel thrice a day with duration
            0:18, 1:06 and 0:38, Activities Summary, available at Show-&gt;Summary will tell
            you that you spent totally 2 hours and 2 minutes on this activity.</p>
        <p>
            It could happen that you forget to log switching activity, in such a case you can
            open Time Log Editor and manually add passed activities, specifying their start,
            duration and end time. It is necessary to specify only two values: start time and duration,
            start time and end time, duration and end time - the third time value will be calculated
            automatically. Also you can correct existing info in Time Log Editor in order to
            make it more correct.</p>
        <h2>
            Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Press 'Done!' button each time you switch between activities, even if it is planned
                to spent seconds on the next activity. It will help you to discover your time thieves.</li>
        </ul>
